DESIGN CONCEPT

Problem: A demonstration of what can be accomplished through CSS-based design. by redesigning csszengarden.com only using CSS. 

Approach: Create and adhere to a theme that will carryout throughout the web page. Make it easy for users to understand the information on the website. Hope that my design will be clear to users what the overall theme is. 

As more brands are moving away from flat design, I want to create a site that uses more current design trends such as bold colors and gradients. I also want to play around with different parallax scrolling and having the scroll of each section move at different speeds. The design of the site overall will be fairly minimalist but adding pops of bright colors and also playing with the speed of different div sections. 

I hope this will help the user be more engaged with the site and also keep it clean and visually appealing.
